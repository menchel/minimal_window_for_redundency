# minimal_window_for_redundency

Code for project in Coding and algorithms for memories course (236379) at the Technion.

This is a python code for creating a graph of the minimal window size for a given redundency bits.

In order to run, you enter the n values needed, and then the deltas to check.

For example:
Enter n: 10
Enter delta values (comma-separated): 1,2,3,4

In the end, the graph will be saved as plot_N=?.png where ? is the end selected.
For this example, it will be plot_N=10.png

NOTE: you need the matplotlib libary in order to run this code.
